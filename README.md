#### Quality Control of raw reads

First, we performed a QC of the raw Illumina data sequences (55 bp amplicon sequencing) using FastQC and MultiQC. After confirming high quality per base score in the guides region (mean Phred score > 30), we continued with the downstream analyses. (qc_crispr.sh script for this step)
