Script based on the code of F. Rousset available at https://gitlab.pasteur.fr/dbikard/ecocg/-/blob/master/Notebook.ipynb
for analysing the CRISPRi screenings based on gRNA counts per gene obtained with the merge_counts.py script.

This first script basically takes the merged table of the guide counts, and checks the reproducibility between
replicates. After plotting the Pearson's R coefficient, it merges all replicates into their same sample
to perform subsequent analyses.
